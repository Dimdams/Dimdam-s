Dimdam's is a module for NodeJs and mainly for Discord.js.
It has several functions like a translator or a loader.

For installe the package :
```js
npm i dimdams
```
for user the translator :
```js
const { translator } = require("dimdams")

translator("text", {to: "en"})
```
you must change `text` to your text and `en` to the abbreviation of the language you want to translate your text into.

For use the loader :
```js
const { loader } = require("dimdams")

loader(client, "path")
```
You must change `client` to your client and `path` to the path of the folder to load.
You will then have a tree of your folder that loads.
